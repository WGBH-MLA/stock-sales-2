### CLIP LICENSING: 

WGBH Stock Sales is the clip licensing division of the WGBH Media Library and Archives. We license originally shot WGBH footage and web content to television producers, publishers and professional media organizations.   

### NAVIGATING WGBH CONTENT
We wish we had all of our programs and content clipped and searchable in an online database.  Unfortunately we don’t!  However, there is a wealth of content on various WGBH sites including the WGBH Media Library and Archives via Open Vault, and individual WGBH program websites.  We want to help you discover this material if you haven’t already.

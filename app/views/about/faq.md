#### How do I search and navigate the site?
Our site has two main search functions.  You can either search our Rights Ready digital clips or search the WGBH Media Library and Archives “sister” site: “Open Vault”.  “Open Vault” features interviews and unique content from selected historical WGBH series which has been digitized.  You can also search and browse the complete WGBH catalog of series and programs from Open Vault.   UNFORTUNATELY IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO SEARCH ACROSS OUR ARCHIVE IN ONE INTEGRATED SEARCH. 

#### What content can I find in the WGBH Collections? 
The WGBH Collections highlight the amazing variety of unique educational content that WGBH has in its archives which you may not be aware of.  These include interviews, music, sports, and articles, interactives, timelines, maps, short videos and more. Most of the WGBH Collection sites have helpful links to help you navigate our program websites and find what you are looking for. You are also able to move easily from one collection to another with our drop down menu. 

### SCREENERS

#### How can I download comps of digital clips?
Simply select the download button at the far right corner of the clip.  The clip with

#### How can I order a screener of a program with time code?
For professional licensing requests ONLY, we can provide a copy of the program with burned in time code as a digital file or DVD for $50.  

#### Can I obtain copies of source materials (interviews, news footage, b-roll, etc)?
We can provide screening copies of these materials for a fee for professional licensing requests only.   

#### How can I find out the source of a shot? Can you send me a shot log from one of your programs?
No.  We do not release our program log but we can provide information to you on the source of the shots you are inquiring about for a fee of $50 per shot. 


### HOW TO LICENSE:

#### How to License or Order Rights Ready Clips:
Copy the clip's 14 digit reference number which begins with GBH and include the clip description and send us an email with your order.  Once payment has been made and you have agreed to our on line license/or a license agreement has been signed, 
we will deliver a high resolution version of the clip to you via a secure online link. 

#### What format and codec is the digital master file for your rights ready clips?
All of our rights ready clips are in TODO codec at TODO. 

#### How do I check out? Why is there no shopping cart function?
We do not have a shopping cart function at this time to “check out” or a Pay Pal or other online credit card payment system.  Please send us an email to order material.  We will process your credit card here at WGBH. 
 
#### What is the licensing process for footage that is not pre-clipped?  
Once it has been determined that material is licensable we will send you a license agreement which you sign and return to us. License and digitizing fees are prepaid before delivery of material.  It can then take up to 48 hours to process your digital files before they can be delivered.  Your broadcast quality master files are delivered via our online service.  We will send you an executed license agreement and credit card receipt as soon as they are available.

#### What formats can you deliver non-clipped footage in?
We can deliver broadcast quality high resolution digital files in the following formats:

TODO

#### Is everything in your programs and on your websites available for licensing?
No. Because we are a program-based archive, WGBH does not necessarily own copyright to all the footage within any given program. While we can’t license footage that we don’t own, we can sometimes provide access to the footage for a fee and with permission from the copyright holder. We can also source this footage for you, also for a fee.  

#### Why can’t I find footage from a certain program on line or in the digital clips?
We have millions of hours of footage and other materials in the WGBH Archive and we are unable to clip and catalog all of it. Our digital clips are only a sampling of our many hours of programming. Please contact us if you can’t find what you need on our site.

#### Is some of your original footage restricted?
Certain material is unavailable for licensing due to reasons such as the sensitive nature of the footage or agreements with interview subjects/locations.  “Frontline” footage, for example, cannot be used for advocacy purposes.  Footage from very recent programs may also be unavailable.

#### Can you license footage from all or any PBS station?
WGBH is only one station in the PBS system and we can only license our own original material.  Please contact other PBS stations directly to license their content.


### OTHER: 

#### Do you sell copies of programs?
No. Please refer to http://www.shoppbs.org for the latest catalog of available programs.  Please note that many PBS programs are no longer available for distribution.

#### I have an old VHS copy of one of your programs.  Can I make a DVD or digital copy?
If the title is not available at www.shoppbs.org , then PBS no longer distributes it and cannot grant these permissions.   Please contact Jena Perrone for any audiovisual questions at jena_perrone@wgbh.org. 

#### I own a DVD of a PBS show.  Can I digitize and stream it online?
No. Your purchase does not permit you to duplicate or alter the program for any purpose, to distribute the program through any network, or to digitize, encode and/or place the program on a digital server.

#### Can you give me permission to use a program in my classroom?
Programs still in distribution with AV rights are available at the PBS Teachers shop at http://teacher.shop.pbs.org/home/index.jsp  
We cannot give you permission to use programs that are out of distribution.

#### Isn’t PBS footage and content in the public domain? 
No. Our content is protected by U.S. copyright law and its use may be subject to the permission of WGBH, performers, unions, or other third parties.

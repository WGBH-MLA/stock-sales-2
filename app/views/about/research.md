## Main
WGBH is a program based archive which means that all our content has been specifically shot or created for our programs. 
You know you want THAT shot from a particular WGBH program and it is NOT in the Digital Clips. 
How do you order it?

1. ## Identify the shot  
We need you to identify the series, program and actual shot and where it appears in the program.

2. ## Give us time codes in and out 
In order to determine this precisely, you may have to order a digital
file with burned in time code and give us exact in and out times with a shot description.

3. ## We confirm the shot is WGBH footage  
Many of our documentaries contain third party materials, so we have to make sure we own the material so we can license it to you.  
 
4. ## Get a rate quote  
Tell us what you are producing your project for:  the market, distribution, term and we will quote you a rate.

5. ## Sign our license agreement

6. ## Make your payment  
We prefer credit card payment whenever possible

7. ## Specify your master format  
We can deliver in a wide range of formats

8. ## DONE!  
We will return a signed, executed copy of the license agreement to you for your files.

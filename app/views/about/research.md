# How to License

## Main
WGBH is a program based archive which means that all our content has been specifically shot or created for our programs. 
You know you want *that* shot from a particular WGBH program, but it is *not* in the Digital Clips Collection, and you cannot find it online. How do you order it?

### 1. Send us an email and identify the shot  
We need you to identify the series, program and actual shot and where it appears in the program.

### 2. Give us in and out timecode
In order to determine this precisely, you may have to order a digital
file with burned in time code and give us exact in and out times with a shot description.

### 3. We confirm the shot is WGBH footage
Many of our documentaries contain third party materials, so we have to make sure we own the material so we can license it to you.  
 
### 4. Get a rate quote  
Tell us what you are producing your project for:  the market, distribution, term and we will quote you a rate.

### 5. Sign our license agreement
Once we receive a signed license agreement we can release master material to you. 

### 6. Make your payment  
We prefer credit card payment whenever possible.

### 7. Specify your master format  
We can deliver in a wide range of formats.

### 8. DONE!  
We will return a signed, executed copy of the license agreement to you for your files.

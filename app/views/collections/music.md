WGBH Interviews and Musical Performances 

## Long

The WGBH music collection consists of interviews with musicians, archival 
performances and specials (e.g. BB King, James Taylor) and musical acts recorded 
in our studios here at WGBH (e.g. Gladys Knight and the Pips, the Delfonics, 
Parliament, Ruben Blades). WGBH also famously recorded the 1968 James Brown 
concert at the Boston Garden in the wake of the assassination of Martin Luther 
King.  In addition, WGBH has broadcast the *Evening at Pops*, featuring guest performers,
for over 40 years.  WGBH co-produced the series *Rock & Roll* (1994) and 
*Latin Music* (2009): many of the WGBH interviews from these series are available 
for licensing.

Did you know that WGBH was the first television station to broadcast professional 
tennis in the US in the 1960s?  

Our sports collection is mainly archival and features footage from the 1960s 
and 1970s (when WGBH had a sports unit) with a smattering of content thereafter 
until current day.  Sports represented include U. S Professional Tennis (John McEnroe, 
Arthur Ashe and Martina Navratilova), Championship Skating (Nancy Kerrigan, Brian 
Boitano and Paul Wylie), Boston Marathon coverage (Bill Rodgers, Johnny Kelley), 
basketball, sailing, golf, and more.  Interviews with sports legends include Muhammad Ali, 
Tom “Satch” Sanders, Jim Brown, Luis Tiant, Phil Esposito and Bobby Orr.

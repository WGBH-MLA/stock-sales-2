For many years WGBH produced a large number of critically acclaimed “limited”
or “stand-alone” multi-episode documentary series.  Most of these series were 
produced between 1983-2000;  their subjects were history, science, current affairs, 
culture, health, music, architecture and more.  For example, “The Health Quarterly” 
ran from XXXX-XXXX and was followed by “The AIDS Quarterly”.  “The Machine that 
Changed the World” focused on the history of the computer,  “Africans in America” 
on slavery, etc.  Click on the link below to download a PDF list of these series.  
Many still remain relevant and are excellent resources in terms of footage, research 
and coverage of their particular subject.

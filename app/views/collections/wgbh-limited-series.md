## Long

[*Sacred Journeys*](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/sacredjourneys) is our most recent limited series. WGBH has produced many other multi-part
documentary series over the years, which have been critically acclaimed and regarded as the authoritative 
work on that particular subject.  Many of these series were produced between 1983-2000:  their subjects were 
history, science, current affairs, culture, health, music, architecture and more.  For example, *The AIDS Quarterly*
was produced in 1989-1990 and was followed by *The Health Quarterly* which ran from 1991-1994. *The Machine that 
Changed the World* focused on the history of the computer,  *Africans in America* 
on slavery, etc.  Many still remain relevant and are excellent resources in terms of footage, research 
and content.
